Day 2 Notes
The information displayed by the ls -l command is as follows:
Column 1) If the first letter is a D, the item in question is a directory
Column 2) The next 3 characters are r(read),w(write),x(execute). These letters relate to the permissions for the owners of the directory in question (named in the 4th column). The second set of 3 letters show group permissions and the final 3 letters indicate what permissions everyone has with the directories.
Column 3) The number of files within the directory
Column 4) Owner
Column 5) Group
Column 6) File Size
Column 7) Date last modified
Column 8) Directory name

The command ls -t displays the directories in order of most recently altered.
You can combine flags (i.e. ls -lt will list the directories in long form, and in the order of most recently altered)

In naming directories/files, Using underscores are called 'snake_case', using hyphens is called 'kebab-case', using uppercase letters to denote a new word is called 'camelCase'.

Self-Reflection
Today, we finished optimizing our development environment in the morning, and moved on to command-line work in the second part of the day. I struggled to focus after lunch due to normal circadian rhythm dropping. I very much enjoyed learning all of the different ways you could create, move, copy and delete files and directories and the work I did on my own, in addition to the instruction given, was very helpful. This was a very important class for me, as I have struggled with file manipulation in the command line in the past. I also enjoyed listening to others' creative ways to use the commands we were taught throughout the day and using some of what I learned from them to help me make better notes. I did struggle with the ls flags, so it would be good for me to practice using those on my own, but overall I grasped much of what was discussed today and feel fairly confident about my ability to use the new commands to help me in the coming classes.
